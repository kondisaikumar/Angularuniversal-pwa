                violations in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act [17 U.S.C. 512] (the “<b>DMCA</b>”). The
                DMCA provides a process for a copyright owner to give notification to BottleCapps concerning alleged

                the DMCA, upon taking down the Content, BottleCapps shall take reasonable steps to contact the owner
                of the removed Content so that a counter-notification (“<b>Counter Notice</b>”) may be filed. On receiving a
                valid Counter Notice, BottleCapps will generally restore the Content in question, unless BottleCapps
                receives notice from the original provider of the Notice of Infringement that a legal action has been filed
